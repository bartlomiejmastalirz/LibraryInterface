// To-Do list
// Make two csv files - users and books, for testing purposes add like two users and books 
// Make a login screen for the user to provide his credentials (login and password)
// Make a main menu screen where the user sees his Name and Surname and can choose: Search|Check rented books status|Rent a book
// 
// Make an ADMIN account that can add users and books to csv files
// Book csv could be sorted by IDs, to make it easier to assign for renting - e.g. User1 rents Book1 with ID of 1; Book1 has its ID added to 
//      booksRented of User1.
//
// Try to avoid a problem with removing a book from the "library" that is already rented - make a flag for books, as in "isRented True/False"
//      if it's rented, then disable deleting it. Unless we want to do something with ADMIN being able to manually delete it from the User data.
//
// If a book is rented out, use the above flag to display till when it's unavailable. For added complexity add a "reservation" check for next user
//      to rent out a book when it's available.
