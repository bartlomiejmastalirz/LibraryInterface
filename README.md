This is a Library Interface project at WSB Merito University. It is a project made strictly for educational purposes and not for professional use.

This project includes a user and book database stored in the repository. Users can log in if they are in the database, browse the library, search for books they want, rent and return them.
Based on Windows Forms, therefore written in C# with SQLite as database management.

To open the program, download the LibraryMain folder with all of its contents.
